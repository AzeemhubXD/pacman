# Fix for "src refspec main does not match any" Error

This error occurs because your local repository uses a branch named `master` while GitHub might be expecting a branch named `main`.

## Solution

Based on the error and your repository status, here's how to fix the issue:

### 1. Verify your current branch

```bash
git branch
```

This shows you're on a branch called `master`.

### 2. Push to the correct branch

Instead of pushing to `main`, push to `master`:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This will upload your master branch to GitHub.

### 3. If GitHub repository expects "main" branch

If you specifically want to use "main" as your default branch on GitHub, you can:

1. Rename your local branch from master to main:
   ```bash
   git branch -m master main
   ```

2. Push the renamed branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Set the upstream branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete master  # Delete the master branch on remote
   git push origin -u main          # Push main and set as upstream
   ```

### 4. Alternative Solution for New Repositories

If this is a brand new repository:

1. Delete the GitHub repository and create a new one
2. Make sure not to initialize it with any files
3. Follow these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main              # Rename master to main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pacman-js.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Status of Your Repository

Based on the status check, your repository appears to be properly configured with:
- Local branch: `master`
- Remote branch: `origin/master`
- All files are committed except for `git_instructions.md`

To add the instructions file:
```bash
git add git_instructions.md
git commit -m "Add GitHub instructions"
git push
```
